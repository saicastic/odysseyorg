    alt: "About theme",
    desc_one: `Life is a series of moments, and each step is an opportunity for growth. "Traditional meets Innovation" is not just a theme; it's a philosophy that encourages individuals to embrace the highs and lows, the challenges and victories, and the unknown paths that make their personal odyssey.`,
    desc_two: `The theme "Tradition Meets Innovation" is a powerful reflection of how the past and the future can coexist, complementing each other to create something truly extraordinary. Tradition represents our cultural heritage, values, and time-honoured practices that have shaped societies for centuries. Innovation, on the other hand, symbolizes progress, creativity, and the limitless possibilities of human ingenuity. When these two forces come together, they pave the way for groundbreaking transformations while preserving the essence of our roots. In today’s rapidly evolving world, the fusion of tradition and innovation is evident in various fields—whether it’s technology reviving ancient art forms, artificial intelligence revolutionizing traditional education, or sustainable solutions drawing inspiration from indigenous knowledge. This theme encourages us to explore how we can modernize customs without losing their authenticity and use innovation to enhance, rather than replace, cultural legacy. At Odyssey 2025, we embrace this intersection, where heritage is not seen as a relic of the past but as a foundation for the future. Through a blend of cultural performances, tech-driven exhibitions, artistic showcases, and interactive experiences, we invite participants to witness how creativity and history merge seamlessly. This fest is not just an event; it is a movement to inspire a generation that values its roots while fearlessly shaping the future. Let us come together to celebrate this journey where tradition fuels innovation, and innovation breathes new life into tradition!`,
